Part 1 : 
    Basic Structure of an HTML Document
    <!DOCTYPE html>
        * Declares that the document type is HTML5.
        * It tells the browser how to interpret the document correctly.
        * Must appear at the very top of every HTML file.
    <html>
        * The root element of an HTML document.
        * All other HTML elements must be placed inside this tag.
        * Usually includes a lang attribute (e.g., <html lang="en">) to specify the language of the content.
    <head>
        * Contains metadata and information not directly displayed on the webpage.
        * Common elements inside <head> include:
        * <meta> → Defines metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings, or page description
        * <title> → Sets the title of the webpage shown in the browser tab.
        * <link> → Connects external files like CSS stylesheets or icons.
        * <script> → Links JavaScript files or includes inline scripts.
    <body>
        * Contains the main content of the webpage — the part visible to users in the browser.
        * Can include:
        * Text, images, links, tables, lists, and forms.
        * Structural tags such as <header>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>.
        * It’s where you design and organize what users will actually see and interact with.
